This is a system for building command-driven interfaces in Dylan.

It can currently be used to declaratively design terminal-based command
interfaces, commonly called shells or CLIs (for Command Line Interface).

We also strive to implement graphical command interfaces in a similar
manner to Symbolics Genera, including support for full graphical and
markup output.

(Full documentation is still TBD.)
